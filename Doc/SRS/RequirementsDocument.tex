\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
\subsubsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}
This project is a  reimplementation of a JavaScript math library called MathJS and we intend on going a step further than the original implementation and creating a website that uses our implementation. We plan on allowing users to input derivative, integral and numerical expression problems that can be solved and outputted straight to the user. The original library featured a flexible expression parser with support for symbolic computation and a large set of built-in functions. Our motivation to make this project is to make a place where complex mathematical expressions can be solved with little effort from the user and to offer a user-friendly service instead of just developing an API like MathJS.

\subsubsection{Goals of the Project}
Our product will allow users to input a variety of mathematical expressions and obtain the answers to these expressions on an elegant, easy to use website. The goals for this project are creating a JavaScript program that implements a library similar to MathJS, documenting the processes involved in making the project and getting a website to host the program. The website is there so users can easily access the program and use it.

\section{Project Constraints}
\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
Description: The product shall operate on computer browsers that allow JavaScript to run through a website hosting server.
\\
\\
Rationale: The user will be using a desktop/laptop and browser that is not outdated to access our site.
\\
\\
Fit criterion: Our website will be usable to users with browsers that have an updated version of JavaScript.
\\
\\
\\
Description: The program shall be used only when connected to the internet so that user inputs can be processed.
\\
\\
Rationale: The internet connection of the user should be appropriate for the program to run.
\\
\\
Fit criterion: The user shall have an internet connection with at least 100kbs upload and download speed
\\
\\
\\
Description: The product shall resize to the different resolutions of internet browsers and the different sizes that browsers use.
\\
\\
Rationale: The user should be able to resize the browser with the program resizing accordingly.
\\
\\

   \caption{Implementation Environment}
   \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
The program relies on React, a JavaScript library to properly layout the user interface to the website. It also relies on a browser supporting JavaScript and a web-hosting server.


\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
For the product to be executed the following off-the-shelf software is required:\begin{itemize}
\item
A web browser
\item
JavaScript (Available from https://java.com/en/download/)
\item
A client where the web browser can run (i.e. desktop, laptop)
\end{itemize}

All three of the OTS software can be received for free off the Internet.


\subsubsection{Anticipated Workspace Environment}
The anticipated workplace environment for the product is anywhere. As long as some sort of internet connection is present, the website can be accessed.


\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
There is no schedule constraint that affects the product requirements. However, a deadline of the beginning of December has been given to finish the project.


\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
There are no budget constraints as everything that is required is either open source or free to use.


\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
The program will be free to use and available on desktop and laptop platforms, that have browsers capable of running JavaScript.

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsubsection{Relevant Facts}
Some relevant facts for this project are that there are 60,000 lines of code in the library. The library has a Apache license and JavaScript is needed to start using the library.

\subsubsection{Business Rules}
The documentation will be equally written by all members of the group. Members will specifically code parts of the project that they feel are stronger at coding.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
Some assumptions about the project are the web-hosting server will be free. Also, React will be available for us to use to build the user interface for the website. In terms of coding, the parser will be coded first, as the rest of the code is reliant on this.

\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
N/A


\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
Since this is based off an open-sourced project, the original implementation can be useful for guidance with the base code for this new open source project.


\subsection{New Problems}
\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
This new service we’re offering will be a new addition to the already massive pool of websites that already exist. Therefore this new website will not have much if any affect on the environment. The only issue that may arise is if there is too much traffic to the website, where we would end up having to upgrade our servers.
\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
There will be no effect on already existing system as the new system will be a new instance of the service.

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
N/A

\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
The only limitation that may be experienced is if the traffic is extremely high on our website, which will result in us having to upgrade our server.

\subsubsection{Follow-Up Problems}
Some problems that may be experienced include not being able to develop a well made and easy to use website since our main priority is getting all our functions to function properly. We are limited by time but we hope to be able to have a fully functional website that’s user friendly and has some nice aesthetics by the end of the semester.

\subsubsection{Planning of the Development Phases}
Phase 1 Parsing Implementation:
This phase is what the rest of the project depends on as we must be able to parse the user's’ input and organize the data in a way to make it easier to manipulate all the data. Organizing all the data to be as specific as possible will make it easier for us to develop the functions since the user’s input will be split up and easily accessible.

Phase 2 Different Mathematical Functions Implementations:
In this phase, we will create all the different functions for each type of mathematical problems. A few examples include finding the derivative, finding the zeros, etc. As the semester goes by, the more excess time we have, the more mathematical problems we will support.

Phase 3 Website development and Hosting Implementation:
After the addition of support for different mathematical problems, a website will be created in order to offer a user-friendly experience where users can input their mathematical problem and receive a nicely formatted solution.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
An efficient way to parse a user’s input could be to use the split function in order to split the user’s input around every space, that way you can have each term of a function in a separate index in an array. Then you can search through the array and search for brackets in order to group up everything in between brackets, if applicable. To do all of this however, would require the assumption that a user has a space between each term.
